# maven-adapter
Maven repository adapter

`com.artipie.maven.Maven` is the central entrypoint for all operations. It uses a
`com.artipie.asto.Storage` to store Maven artifacts.

Current implementation is focused on generating metadata for artifacts on repository.

Taking the repository described above in Layout section, for example, let's suppose that a new version, 
`2.0` was uploaded to the repository. We generate the metadata this way: 

```java
    Metadata updated = new Maven(
        storage
    ).update("org.example.artifact");
```

The `metadata.xml` file will be generated with the recently added data pertaining to version `2.0`.

## Maven concepts

### Files

A dependency is identified by its _coordinates_ - groupId, artifactId and version.
JAR files may contain a classifier suffix - `sources` or `javadoc`.
By coordinates you can determine the artifact path in local or remote repository and vice versa.

Repositories must handle following types of files:
- A primary artifact - a main JAR file.
- Secondary artifacts - a POM file, files with a classifier.
- Attribute files - checksums, signatures, lastUpdate files for primary and secondary artifacts.
- Metadata files - `maven-metadata.xml`, containing information about artifact versions
including snapshot versions.

File naming convention is:
`artifactId-version[-classifier]-extension`

### Layout

(Default) naming convention is - in groupId replace all dots with directory separator ('/')
then put artifactId, version and then go files.

Example layout (not fully exhaustive):
```
$ROOT
|-- org/
    `-- example/
        `-- artifact/
            `-- maven-metadata.xml
            `-- maven-metadata.xml.sha1
            `-- 1.0/
                |-- artifact-1.0.jar
                |-- artifact-1.0.jar.sha1
                |-- artifact-1.0.pom
                |-- artifact-1.0.pom.sha1
                |-- artifact-1.0-sources.jar
                |-- artifact-1.0-sources.jar.sha1
```

For example, for an artifact `org.example:artifact:1.0` (Gradle-style notation is used for clarity)
the path would be `org/example/artifact/1.0/artifact-1.0.jar` (and other files).

###Snapshot repositories
Maven supports the use of `snapshot` repositories. These repositories are used only when resolving `SNAPSHOT` dependencies.
`SNAPSHOT` dependencies are just like regular dependencies, with `-SNAPSHOT` appended to it:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.artipie</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-adapter</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

This feature allows anyone which depends on the `SNAPSHOT` version get the latest changes on every build.

<!--
@todo #81:30min Snapshot repository support
 Add snapshot repository support to maven adapter. Snapshot repositories allows the download of the latest 
 dependency version with the `SNAPSHOT` tag. Repositories marked with snapshot flag should be able to resolve
 snapshot dependencies, which means that if we have a snapshot repository it will be able to download the
 snapshot (latest) version of the used libraries. For more info on how snapshot repositories work, see 
 https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2017/03/09/how-does-a-maven-repository-work/#release-and-snapshot-repositories
 . Start by creating interfaces for repository, then snapshot repositories and implementing
 unit and integration tests assuring that common repositories do not allows the usage of snapshot libraries 
 (and snapshot repositories allows it) and then implement the snapshot feature itself.

## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```
To avoid build errors use Maven 3.2+.
